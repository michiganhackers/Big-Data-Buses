# Big-Data-Buses

## Overview

Our mission is to significantly improve the bus experience at University of Michigan. We hope to collect statistics and rider data relating to bus usage to create a reliable representation of real-time transportation services. We will then relay this information through phone and web applications. We intend for this application to be used by the population of Ann Arbor residents who use the Blue Bus service on a regular basis.

###General Features

#### Bus Locations
Will specify the location of all routes to the user. The user will have the option to filter which routes they want. 

#### Wait times for next bus
Will specify the predicted wait time to the user.

#### Directions to relevant bus stops
Users should be able to locate the nearest bus stops that will allow them to travel to their intended destination

#### Out of service notification
Predict whether or not a bus will go out of service soon to a certain degree of accuracy and accurately relay this information to the user.

#### Number of People on each bus
 Track how crowded each bus is so that people can avoid overcrowding.

#### Google Calendar integration
Will pull events from the users Google Calendar and notify of an optimal bus route to use to get to that location

#### Route notification
Notifies the user when a selected route or bus will arrive at a certain location.
  

### Data to Track


+ Bus Location
+ User Location
+ Number of people present on each bus
+ Users Google Calendar
+ Traffic
+ Average time on bus
+ Time of day

### How to track


+ Access to doublemap API
+ Bluetooth sniffing
+ Device(Computer/Mobile) Location
+ Google Calendar API
+ Google Maps API

### Timeline

+ 2/23 - Project Spec
+ 3/23 - MVP / Alpha release
+ 4/20 - Beta Release / Working product

### Current Tasks


#### User outreach
Polls predicted users on a variety of questions including possible features of the service. 
+ Facebook surveys
+ Email surveys (Michigan Hackers email blast, other University announcements)
+ Flyers at CC Little
+ Bus flyers


#### API access
Researches and gains access to both the Double Map API and the Google maps/calendar API. Talk to transportation services to determine what data we can obtain from the University. 

####Backend setup
Sets up a web database. Create our own API to upload data and communicate between devices/apps to backend.


#### Hardware tracking
Researches potential hardware (Raspberry pi, arduino, etc) to track position, number of people on bus, etc. (needs internet connection)
+  Talk to university about getting access to tablets on buses

#### UI mockup/wireframe
Creates a basic user interface (web and mobile) for visualizing and using data

### MVP
Our MVP aims to be a more polished version of the current bus app. 
+ Number of People on each bus
+ Display current Routes to users
+ User Position
+ Wait times (from DoubleMap)
+ Talk to doublemap API/Transportation services

### Architecture
